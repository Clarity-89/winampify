<a href="http://winampify.io">Winampify</a> aims at providing an OS-like interface to interact with Spotify in the browser.

Artists, albums and tracks are all rendered as files and folders and can easily be manipulated and played in the Winamp re-implementation <a href="https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp">Webamp</a>.

## Motivation

Building softwares should be fun. This project is mostly a sandbox for me to try and improve my knowledge of React and TypeScript. It is also the first large-scale project that I'm undertaking on my own, and is in constant need of refactoring.

## Requirements

You need a Spotify Premium Account to access Winampify.

## Thank you

Winamp's reimplementation is the work of <a href="https://github.com/captbaritone">captbaritone-js</a>.
